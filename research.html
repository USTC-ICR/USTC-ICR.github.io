		<p class="rteindent1 rtejustify research-content">
			Reinforcement learning has presented great potential in learning policies for dexterous manipulations. While many existing works have focused on rigid objects, it remains an open problem to manipulate articulated objects and generalize across different categories. To address these challenges, we develop a novel framework that enhances diffusion policy using linear temporal logic (LTL) representations and affordance learning to improve the learning efficiency and generalizability of articulated dexterous manipulation.

			We develop an End-to-End Legged Perceptive Parkour Skill Learning (LEEPS) framework to train quadruped robots to master parkour skills in complex environments. In particular, LEEPS incorporates a vision-based perception module equipped with multi-layered scans, supplying robots with comprehensive, precise, and adaptable information about their surroundings. Leveraging such visual data, a position-based task formulation liberates the robot from velocity constraints and directs it toward the target using innovative reward mechanisms. The resulting controller empowers an affordable quadruped robot to successfully traverse previously challenging and unprecedented obstacles. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/leeps"target="_blank"><strong>[Experiment Video]</strong></a>

		</p>
		<p class="rteindent1 rtejustify research-content">
			Temporal logic-based motion planning has been extensively studied to address complex robotic tasks. However, existing works primarily focus on static environments or assume the robot has full observations of the environment. This limits their practical applications since real-world environments are often dynamic, and robots may suffer from partial observations. To tackle these issues, this study proposes a framework for vision-based reactive temporal logic motion planning (V-RTLMP) for robots integrated with LiDAR sensing. The V-RTLMP is designed to perform high-level linear temporal logic (LTL) tasks in unstructured dynamic environments.

		<p class="rteindent1 rtejustify research-content">
			This work proposes a control framework to consider hard constraints to enforce safety requirements and soft constraints to enable task relaxation. The metric interval temporal logic (MITL) specifications are employed to deal with time constraints. By constructing a relaxed timed product automaton, an online motion planning strategy is synthesized with a receding horizon controller to generate policies, achieving multiple objectives in decreasing order of priority 1) formally guarantee the satisfaction of hard safety constraints; 2) mostly fulfill soft timed tasks; 3) collect time-varying rewards as much as possible.	<a href="Papers/Journals/[38]_2022LCSS_MITL.pdf"target="_blank"><strong>[Paper]</strong></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbFlxj_ZCyA"target="_blank"><strong>[Experiment Video]</strong></a>	</p>

		</p>
		<p class="rteindent1 rtejustify research-content">
			Existing DMP-based methods mainly focus on simple go-to-goal tasks. Motivated to handle tasks beyond point-to-point motion planning, this work presents temporal logic guided optimization of motion primitives for complex manipulation tasks with user preferences. In particular, weighted truncated linear temporal logic (wTLTL) is incorporated, which not only enables the encoding of complex tasks that involve a sequence of logically organized action plans with user preferences, but also provides a convenient and efficient means to design the cost function. The black-box optimization is then adapted to identify optimal shape parameters of DMPs to enable motion planning of robotic systems.	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGnVKqC-T-A"target="_blank"><strong>[Experiment Video]</strong></a>	</p>

		</p>
		<p class="rteindent1 rtejustify research-content">
			Dynamic coverage control is a type of cooperative control which requires a multi-agent system to dynamically monitor an area of interest over time. To develop motion control laws, most of previous works highly rely on the knowledge of system models, such as the environment model and agent kinematics/dynamics. However, acquiring an accurate model can be restrictive and even impossible in many practical applications. Another challenge is that agent often has a limited communication capability in practice. Two agents may only exchange information when they are within a certain distance. To address these challenges, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based control framework is developed.<a href="Papers/Journals/[36]_2021LCSS_MARL.pdf"target="_blank"><strong>[Paper]</strong></a>	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG10y8Hvh24"target="_blank"><strong>[Experiment Video]</strong></a>	</p>

		</p>
		<p class="rteindent1 rtejustify research-content">
			We investigate the motion planning of autonomous dynamical systems modeled by Markov decision processes (MDP) with unknown transition probabilities over continuous state and action spaces. Linear temporal logic (LTL) is used to specify high-level tasks over infinite horizon. The novelty is to design an embedded product MDP (EP-MDP) and the proposed reward shaping and discounting schemes for the model-free reinforcement learning (RL) only depend on the EP-MDP states. A modular deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is then developed to generate such policies over continuous state and action spaces.<a href="Papers/Journals/[34]_2021_RAL.pdf"target="_blank"><strong>[Paper]</strong></a>	<a href="https://github.com/mingyucai/Modular_Deep_RL_E-LDGBA"target="_blank"><strong>[Code & Videos]</strong></a>	</p>

		</p>
		<p class="rteindent1 rtejustify research-content">
			We consider online optimal motion planning of an autonomous agent subject to linear temporal logic (LTL) constraints. Since user-specified tasks may not be fully realized (i.e., partially infeasible) in a complex environment, we consider hard and soft LTL constraints, where hard constraints enforce safety requirements (e.g., avoid obstacles) while soft constraints represent tasks that can be relaxed to not strictly follow user specifications. The motion planning of the agent is to generate trajectories, in decreasing order of priority, to 1) guarantee the satisfaction of safety constraints; 2) mostly fulfill soft constraints (i.e., minimize the violation cost if desired tasks are partially infeasible); 3) locally optimize rewards collection over a finite horizon.<a href="ResearchTopics/2021LCSS_Arxiv.pdf"target="_blank"><strong>[Paper]</strong></a>	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16j6TmVUrTk"target="_blank"><strong>[Experiment Video]</strong></a>	</p>
